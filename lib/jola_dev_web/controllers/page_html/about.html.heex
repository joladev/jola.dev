        Hiya! I'm currently working as the Director of Engineering at Screenverse, a company in the ad tech industry. I'm a big fan of the Elixir programming language and community and I've been a pretty frequent speaker at conferences.

        Before Screenverse I worked with travel, focused on high throughput CPU intensive processing but more importantly, on starting up and leading teams, taking them from zero to productivity and supporting my coworkers with mentoring and coaching. Before that I did cyber security, building Cloudflare workers that could run between your app and your clients and seamlessly apply intelligent rules to deny fraudulent login attempts. I also spent a few years working for a health tech company in Sweden. All in all I've got over 14 years of professional software engineering experience.
